# ncaa-06-scheduler
Program that allows you to edit the schedule for NCAA Football 06 (and possibly other NCAA PS2 games)
Currently, this program takes in 2 excel files (demos are in the source/main/resources folder, you will need to download these separately as a file picker is now used to select your files).

1. My_Custom_Conferences: this file contains the data for every FBS school, their conference, their rivals, etc
2. SCHED: This is the schedule exported from NCAA Football. 

This program creates a new schedule file that can be converted to a csv file and then imported into PS2 NCAA Football dynasties at the beginning of seasons. (Pre-season is the only time I have attempted to modify the schedule)
If you want to use this program, you should modify the My_Custom_Conferences file to be set to your conferences and also export your schedule from your dynasty.
